<div class="col-1-1"><h1 class="page-title about">About</h1><p class="long-text">Hi, I'm <strong>Nick</strong>. I am a product designer. Besides design, I enjoy sports, outdoor activities, reading, and spending time with my family. Here is a little bit about me and my thoughts on design:</p><h2 class="bc">Approach</h2><p class="long-text">I like to look at product design as an exercise in problem solving. Start by thinking about how the user will interact with the product and how each interaction will help the user perform the task at hand or, as Clayton Christensen would put it, to accomplish the job it has hired the product to do.</p><blockquote>"People view designers as artists, but their fundamental role is problem solver" - Fast Company</blockquote><h2 class="bc">Influences</h2><p class="long-text">I enjoy reading and am very interested how others approach the design process. I really like what <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/" target="blank">Teehan & Lax</a> have been doing. Not only does it look good, but what I have read on their blog about the approach they take on a specific project, I think, is great. I have returned to their post about <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/story/medium/" target="_blank">designing Medium</a> many times. Others that I tend to read often are articles from <a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a> and thoughts from <a href="http://www.gv.com/library/design/" target="_blank">Google Venture’s Design team</a>.</p><blockquote>"Customers judge online credibility by evaluating visual design, copywriting, and interactions." - Braden Kowitz</blockquote><h2 class="bc">Learning</h2><p class="long-text">Throughout my career I have found that because this is what I love to do, I never stop trying to gain new knowledge or insights that will help me inprove myself as well as my work. I have gone the traditional education route earning a Bachelors degree with a focus on English Literature and Journalism and a Masters degree in Human Computer Interaction. I have also done the non-traditional, Starter League (Code Academy when I attended) web development course that I know you are very familiar with. Both the traditional and the non-traditional experiences helped me in different ways to become better at what I do, but I have also learned so much from the people I have worked with and I hope they have learned from me as well.</p><blockquote>“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” - Mahatma Gandhi</blockquote><h2 class="bc">Why I am interested in working at Basecamp</h2><p class="long-text">It is a product I have used and a company I have admired for quite some time. I think it was when I discovered the book “Getting Real”. I really started to think seriously about working at Basecamp when I read the blog post by Jason "The person they’ll become". It resonated with me by the fact that it is about continuous improvement.</p><p class="long-text">Most important to me though is about the people you work with. How do I know Basecamp is the right fit for me? I don’t, but I would like to get the opportunity to meet and see.</p><h2 class="bc">Contact</h2><ul class="contact-info"><li>Nick Shank</li><li><a href="mailto:nicholas.shank@gmail.com">nicholas.shank@gmail.com</a></li><li>537 Aberdeen Rd.
