The primary users were the Office of Continuing Medical Education, Activity Directors, and Physicians.</p><img class="work-image" src="images/cme-flow.png" alt="CME Task FLow"><h2 class="bc hz-line">Process</h2><p class="work-text">Learning the process of how Continuing Medical Education credits was my first step to better understand the goals of this project. I met with the primary stakeholders to determine the business needs and to better understand the problem we were trying to solve. The primary user groups were administrators in the CME office and physicians who submit applications. Both groups were interviewed and process flows were created. I developed wireframes for all screens and notated the interactions that I then shared for review and feedback with the stakeholders and the software engineers. The team began coding both front-end and back-end with regular checkpoints with the stakeholders.</p><img class="work-image" src="images/cme-admin.png" alt="CME Administration"><h2 class="bc hz-line">Involvement</h2><p class="work-text">Working closely with the two software engineers on the team, I designed and developed the front-end using html, css, and jQuery. This process involved daily collaboration within the team.</p><h2 class="bc hz-line">Outcome</h2><p class="work-text">The eCME application was gradually phased into the process of submitting Continuing Medical Education proposals. The application decreased the need to print large proposals and eliminated the need of a physical submission process.</p></div><div class="col-1-1"><ul class="work-list paging"><li><a href="#/hermes"><div class="work-item hermes"><img src="images/hermes-th.png" alt="Hermes Thumbnail"><div class="work-details"><h2>Hermes <span>Web Application</span></h2></div></div></a></li><li><a href="#/splash"><div class="work-item"><img src="images/splash1.png" alt="SplashShop Thumbnail"><div class="work-details"><h2>SplashShop<span>E-Commerce</span></h2></div></div></a></li><li></li></ul><h2 class="bc">Contact</h2><ul class="contact-info"><li>Nick Shank</li><li><a href="mailto:nicholas.shank@gmail.com">nicholas.shank@gmail.com</a></li><li>537 Aberdeen Rd.
