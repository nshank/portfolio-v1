I did competitive analysis to find best practices on e-commerce experiences. I was also tasked with managing the relationship between our team and the third party vendor. I also wireframed the mobile experience for the SplashShop. This included layout of how the products were presented as well as the check out/purchase process and how it could be most efficient on a mobile phone.</p><img class="work-image" src="images/splash-mobile-comp1.png" alt="Splash Mobile Comp"><h2 class="bc hz-line">Involvement</h2><p class="work-text">The launching of SplashShop was a true team effort.
